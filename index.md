### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was a favorite of mine because it helped me become familiar with the game Black Jack and how point distribution works. It also helped me fully understand how command line arguments work in that the first argument will always be the ./ command followed by whatever the user entered.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was a favorite of mine because it was a more sophisticated version of the Hi-Lo game we've made in previous labs. By keeping the majority of the code in a loop and the loop condition checking how many guesses the player has left we reduce repeated code and keep the loop going until the player has no guesses remaining.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1 was a favorite of mine because I learned how to read and input data to a file. Much like using std::cout and std::cin, reading from a file uses the >> operator similar to how in std::cin the >> operator reads input from the keyboard. Writing to a file uses << operator similar to how in std::cout the << operator send information from our program to the screen.
